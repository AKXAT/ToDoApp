# Build Todo Application

## Phase 1 (currently they are admin based): 

1. Todo Application in Django Admin
2. Create Models for Todo
3. User should be able to do following operations from django admin
4. Create Todo
5. Edit
6. List All
7. Delete

## Phase 2

1. Non Django Admin Part
2. User Login Page (No need to do registration, we can add user from django admin)
3. After Login, user will go on Todo listing page. Each logged in user will see his own todo.
4. There should be a link to goto add new Todo
5. Page to add new Todo.
